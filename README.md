 Web Form
# Business Analytics Student Survey (HW9)

This project is a four-page web form designed to collect information from Business Analytics students at the University of Iowa. The form helps the department better understand the student population by asking questions about demographics, academic progress, and completed courses.

## Form Design Best Practices

This web form was built following modern best practices to ensure it's user-friendly and easy to complete. One best practice I followed was keeping the form layout simple and structured across four separate pages. This helps reduce user fatigue and improves completion rates. Each page has clear headings and brief, focused questions, which guide the user step by step.

Another best practice I applied was using placeholder text, labels, and input types that make it clear what kind of data is expected. For example, the form uses `required` fields to prevent users from submitting incomplete data, and `autofocus` to guide the user's attention. I also used radio buttons for single-choice questions and checkboxes for multiple-choice responses, which are standard practices for data collection.

Finally, I added a tooltip with a Font Awesome icon to provide extra help without cluttering the interface. This small addition helps make the form more supportive for users who may need clarification, especially for questions that could be interpreted in different ways.

## Accessibility Features

Accessibility was a key part of this project. The form is fully responsive, so it works well on phones, tablets, and desktops. I followed WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines by using semantic HTML5 elements (like `<fieldset>`, `<legend>`, and `<label>`), which improve screen reader compatibility. Input elements are labeled properly, and required fields provide clear validation feedback.

To help all users, I used high-contrast text and buttons through Bootstrap 5.3, making the form readable for users with vision impairments. The tooltip also meets accessibility needs by offering context in a non-disruptive way. All of these elements ensure that the form is inclusive and usable by as many people as possible.
